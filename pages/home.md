My name is Weijie Li, and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Software Engineering at the School of Software, Xinjiang University.  I received my Bachelor's degree in Resource Exploration Engineering from the School of Resources and Geosciences, China University of Mining and Technology.

My research focus lies within the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), with specific interests in dialogue generation, common-sense reasoning, and text style transfer. 

In my personal life, I enjoy watching anime as a form of relaxation. Additionally, I'm passionately engaged in innovative development projects, through which I continually challenge and enhance myself, aiming to meet the various needs of my everyday life. 

Currently, I'm dedicating myself to an [academic template project](https://github.com/SilverBeats/academic-page). Although this template is still in its nascent stage with many areas awaiting refinement, if you're interested, I warmly welcome you to clone and fork this project.
