I am Weijie Li, a Ph.D. candidate in Software Engineering at Soochow University in Suzhou, China, pursuing my Ph.D. since 2025 under the supervision of [Prof. Guodong Zhou](https://web.suda.edu.cn/gdzhou) and co-supervision of [Prof. Zhongqing Wang](https://wangzqsuda.github.io). I previously earned an M.Eng. in Software Engineering from Xinjiang University in Urumqi, China, between 2021 and 2024. Before transitioning into software engineering, I completed my B.Eng. in Resource Exploration Engineering at the China University of Mining and Technology in Xuzhou, China, from 2016 to 2020. I can be reached via email at <a href="mailto:silverbeats@qq.com">silverbeats@qq.com</a>.

My research focus lies within the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), with specific interests in dialogue generation, common-sense reasoning, and text style transfer. 

In my personal life, I enjoy watching anime as a form of relaxation. Additionally, I'm passionately engaged in innovative development projects, through which I continually challenge and enhance myself, aiming to meet the various needs of my everyday life. 

Currently, I'm dedicating myself to an [academic template project](https://github.com/SilverBeats/academic-page). Although this template is still in its nascent stage with many areas awaiting refinement, if you're interested, I warmly welcome you to clone and fork this project. I am also developing [easy_tools](https://github.com/SilverBeats/easy_tools), an open-source collection of utility scripts and tools that I frequently use in my daily development workflow. The project is already available on GitHub and is designed to streamline common programming tasks. You're welcome to explore, use, or contribute to it.
