# Engaged Research Projects

**Study on Key Technologies for Chinese Irony Recognition Based on Multimodal Data (Xinjiang Natural Science Foundation, 2022D01A99)**

I was involved in the construction of a dataset specifically focused on Chinese ironic expressions. In this process, we recorded relevant context, specific types of irony, and the target objects of the irony for each data entry. This dataset has been submitted to the CCAC 2024 conference as an evaluation task aimed at testing and advancing the development of algorithms for understanding irony. This task attracted participation from 26 teams. During the competition, I served as a technical coordinator, responsible for ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the data, including standardizing the data format and fairly evaluating the results submitted by each team, calculating their final scores.

**Study on Irony Computation Based on Semantic Representation and Affect Transfer (National Natural Science Foundation of China, No. 62066044)**

I was involved in the project for constructing a Chinese multimodal humor and irony dataset. In the early stages of the project, I participated in the preprocessing work for generated subtitle files, which included integrating semantic segments, adding correct punctuation, and text correction to improve data quality.

During the phase of defining annotation requirements, I contributed to internal team discussions that determined the annotation fields, specifically whether content contained irony, humorous elements, and their specific types. To refine classification criteria, I conducted literature research to clarify the characteristics and boundaries of various types of humor and irony, ensuring consistency and accuracy in subsequent annotations.

Given the large size of the data files and the inconvenience of traditional file transfer methods, we developed an online annotation system. I primarily handled front-end development to ensure that annotators could smoothly watch videos online and complete their annotation tasks.

In the later stages of the project, I was responsible for compiling statistical information about the dataset, including the distribution of various humorous and ironic elements. Additionally, based on this dataset, I reproduced several baseline models to validate the effectiveness of the dataset and the feasibility of the models.
