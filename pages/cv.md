# Engaged Research Projects

**Study on Key Technologies for Chinese Irony Recognition Based on Multimodal Data (Xinjiang Natural Science Foundation, 2022D01A99)**

I contributed to the creation of a dataset focused on Chinese satirical expressions and submitted it to the CCAC 2024 conference as a benchmark task. This task attracted 26 teams to participate in the competition. During the competition, I served in a technical support role, providing data and calculating the scores of participating teams.

**Study on Irony Computation Based on Semantic Representation and Affect Transfer (National Natural Science Foundation of China, No. 62066044)**

I was deeply involved in building a multimodal humor and sarcasm dataset in Chinese, encompassing data collection, data cleaning, establishment of annotation rules, development of annotation tools, replication of baseline models, and paper writing.
